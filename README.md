This is Scheduled URL Opener, an extension that opens links at scheduled times per your request! 

Use the extension to perform tasks like automating joining virtual meetings or opening a youtube video at a scheduled break time, thus optimizing your daily workflow.

The extension was made possible with Manifest V3. The user interface (which includes an editable list of set URLs and times) was designed using HTML, CSS and JS.
The backend of the extension, which deals with creating and storing "alarms" (objects that fire and open the URLS you set at the scheduled times), was coded in JS.
